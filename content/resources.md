## R and RStudio

- [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/) 

- [Download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

The first thing you need to do to get started with R is to install it on your computer. R works on pretty much every platform available, including the widely available Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems. If you want to watch a step-by-step tutorial on how to install R for Mac or Windows, you can watch these videos:

Next you can install Rstudio. Remember, you must have R already installed before installing Rstudio. If you want to watch a step-by-step watch the vedio [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM7Sfz-LADM&feature=youtu.be).
