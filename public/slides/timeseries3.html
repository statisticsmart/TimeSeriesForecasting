# Non-Stationary Time Series

**1. Deterministic trend**

`$$Y_t  = f(t) + \epsilon_t$$`


where `\(\epsilon_t \sim iid(0, \sigma^2)\)`, `\(t = 1, 2, ...T\)`

Mean of the process is time dependent, but the variance of the process is constant.

**2. Random walk**

`$$Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$`

**3. Random walk with drift**

`$$Y_t = \alpha+  Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$`

**4. Random walk with drift and deterministic trend**

---
# Common trend removal (de-trending) procedures

1. Deterministic trend: Time-trend regression

      The trend can be removed by fitting a deterministic polynomial time trend. The residual series after removing the trend will give us the de-trended series.

1. Stochastic trend: Differencing
 
      The process is also known as a **Difference-stationary process**.



---

# Trend stationary time series

---

# Difference stationary time series

--
      
# Notation: I(d)

Integrated to order `\(d\)`, `\(I(d)\)`:

series can be made stationary by differencing `\(d\)` times.



---

# Difference stationary process: Random walk model (RW)

**Question: ** Show that random walk process is an `\(I(1)\)` process.

---

# Deterministic trend + Stochastic trend: Random walk with drift (RWD)


---

# Summary: RW vs RWD

---

# Variance stabilization

Eg:

- Square root: `\(W_t = \sqrt{Y_t}\)`

- Logarithm: `\(W_t = log({Y_t})\)`

     - This very useful.
     
     - Interpretable: Changes in a log value are **relative (percent) changes on the original sclae**.

# Box-Cox transformation

$$
  f(x)=\begin{cases}
    1, &amp; \text{if `\(x&lt;0\)`} \newline
    0, &amp; \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
$$


Different values of `\(\lambda\)` gives you different transformations.

- `\(\lambda=1\)`: No **substantive** transformation

- `\(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\)`: Square root plus linear transformation

- `\(\lambda=0\)`: Natural logarithm

- `\(\lambda = -1\)`: Inverse plus 1

Balance the seasonal fluctuations and random variation across the series.

# Box-Cox transformation: R codes

**BoxCox.lambda: Automatic selection of Box Cox transformation parameter**


```r
forecast::BoxCox.lambda(AirPassengers)
```

```

```

Some times this value is not sensible.

**BoxCox: Transformation of the input variable using a Box-Cox transformation**

```r
lambda &lt;- forecast::BoxCox.lambda(AirPassengers)
w &lt;- BoxCox(AirPassengers, lambda)
```

You can pass a user-defined value for `lambda`.

What differences do you notice in the scale?

## Note: Box-Cox Transformation

- If `\(\lambda = 0\)`? 

    - Behaves like log transformation. 
    
    - Force forecasts to be positive.
--

- If `\(\lambda =1\)`? No transformation is needed.
--

- If some `\(Y_t = 0\)`?, then must have `\(\lambda &gt; 0\)`.
--
- If some `\(Y_t &lt; 0\)`? Use power transformation or adjust the time series **by adding a constant to all values.**

--

- Choose a simple value of `\(\lambda\)`. It makes explanations easier.

--

- Transformation oftem makes little difference to forecasts but has large effects on PI.

# Interpretation of R output: ARIMA model 

.content-box-yellow[Intercept form]

Using the backshift notation.

`$$(1-\phi_1B-...-\phi_pB^p)Y'_t=c+(1+\theta_1B+...+\theta_qB^q)\epsilon_t$$`

.content-box-yellow[Mean form]

`$$(1-\phi_1B-...-\phi_pB^p)(Y'_t-\mu)=c+(1+\theta_1B+...+\theta_qB^q)\epsilon_t$$`
Where,

 - `\(Y'_t=(1-B)^dY_t\)`
 
 - `\(\mu = E(Y'_t)\)`, when `\(d \neq 0\)`, otherwise `\(\mu = E(Y'_t)\)`.
 
 - `\(c = \mu(1-\phi_1 - ... - \phi_p)\)`
 
 R always return an estimate of `\(\mu\)`. 
 
 
 &lt;!--How constant relate to the mean of the process. These forms are equivalent. When you can relate c to mu. ARMA models are fitted to the stationary data. Hence, we get mean of stationary data. Data can be stationary in two ways, on it's own or by taking the differencing. If differencing is applied, then you get mean of differenced series, otherwise you get mean of original series.--&gt;

# `Arima` in R

1. When `\(d=0\)`, provides estimate of `\(\mu = E(Y_t)\)`.

2. Default setting is `include.mean=TRUE`. Setting `includemean=FALSE` will force `\(c=\mu=0\)`.

3. When `\(d &gt; 0\)` sets `\(c=\mu=0\)`.

4. When `\(d=1\)` setting `include.drift=TRUE`, estimates `\(\mu\neq0\)` as `drift`.

5. When `\(d&gt;1\)` no constant is allowed.

# Identifying suitable ARIMA models

---

# Modelling steps

1. Plot the data.

--
2. If necessary, transform the data (using a Box-Cox transformation) to stabilise the variance.
--

3. If the data are non-stationary, take first differences of the data until the data are stationary.
--

4. Examine the ACF/PACF to identify a suitable model.
--

5. Try your chosen model(s), and use the AICc to search for a better model.
--

6. Check the residuals from your chosen model by plotting the ACF of the residuals, and doing a portmanteau test of the residuals. If they do not look like white noise, try a modified model.

--
7. Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.

# Step 1: Plot data

1. Detect unusual observations in the data

1. Detect non-stationarity by visual inspections of plots

Stationary series:

- has a constant mean value and fluctuates around the mean.

- constant variance.

- no pattern predictable in the long-term.

## Step 3: Take difference series

### Identifying non-stationarity by looking at plots

- Time series plot

- The ACF of stationary data drops to zero relatively quickly.

- The ACF of non-stationary data decreases slowly.

- For non-stationary data, the value of `\(r_t\)` is often large and positive.

--
### Recap: Non-seasonal differencing and seasonal differencing

** Non seasonal first-order differencing:** `\(Y'_t=Y_t - Y_{t-1}\)`

&lt;!--Miss one observation--&gt;

**Non seasonal second-order differencing:** `\(Y''_t=Y'_t - Y'_{t-1}\)`

&lt;!--Miss two observations--&gt;

**Seasonal differencing:** `\(Y_t - Y_{t-m}\)`

&lt;!--To get rid from prominent seasonal components. --&gt;

- For monthly, `\(m=12\)`, for quarterly, `\(m=4\)`.

&lt;!--We will loosefirst 12 observations--&gt;


- Seasonally differenced series will have `\(T-m\)` observations.
&lt;!--Usually we do not consider differencing more than twice. --&gt;

&gt; There are times differencing once is not enough. However, in practice,it is almost never necessary to go beyound second-order differencing.

&lt;!--Even the second-order differencing is very rare.--&gt;

---
# Step 3: Take difference series (cont.)

🙋

.content-box-yellow[Seasonal differencing or Non-seasonal differencing?]

&lt;!--Take seasonal differencing first. Seasonal differencing might be enough, you do not need to do further differencing. First order seasonal differencing never removes the seasonal effect.--&gt;

🙋

.content-box-yellow[Interpretation of differencing?]

&lt;!--It is important that if the differencing is used, the differences are interpretable. --&gt;

&lt;!--First differences are the change between one observation and the next. Changes of index. Second order differencing is changes of changes.--&gt;

&lt;!--Seasonal differences are the change between one year to the next.--&gt;

&lt;!--But taking lag 3 differences for yearly data, for example, results in a model which cannot be sensible interpreted.--&gt;

&lt;!--It is important that the differencing are interpretable.--&gt;

# Step 6: Residual diagnostics

## Fitted values: 

`\(\hat{Y}_{t|t-1}\)`: Forecast of `\(Y_t\)` based on observations `\(Y_1,...Y_t\)`.


## Residuals

`$$e_t=Y_t - \hat{Y}_{t|t-1}$$`

### Assumptions of residuals

- `\(\{e_t\}\)` uncorrelated. If they aren't, then information left in residuals that should be used in computing forecasts.

&lt;!--If you see autocorrelations, then you should go back and adjust residuals. In theoretically, If there is information leftover and we can do something better. But it is not the case you will also be able to do with. If can't you can't. Then stop. If you check you know you have done the best as you can.--&gt;

- `\(\{e_t\}\)` have mean zero. If they don't, then forecasts are biased.

&lt;!--If you see autocorrelations, then you should go back and adjust residuals. We want our residuals to be unbiased. If the mean is not zero. Go and adjust the model. Add an intercept. Whatever you want to do.--&gt;

### Useful properties (for prediction intervals)

- `\(\{e_t\}\)` have constant variance.

- `\(\{e_t\}\)` are normally distributed.

&lt;!--If the following assumptions are wrong that doesn't mean your forecasts are incorrect. --&gt;

---

# Step 6: Residual diagnostics


---

# Step 7: Calculate forecasts

---

# Step 8: Evaluate forecast accuracy.

## How well our model is doing for out-of-sample?


&lt;!--So far we have talked about fitted values and residuals.--&gt;

&lt;!--Train data and Test data. We want to know if forecasts doing well for out-of-sample.--&gt;

Forecast error = True value - Observed value

`$$e_{T+h}=Y_{T+h}-\hat{Y}_{T+h|T}$$`

Where,

`\(Y_{T+h}\)`: `\((T+h)^{th}\)` observation, `\(h=1,..., H\)`

`\(\hat{Y}_{T+h|T}\)`: Forecast based on data uo to time `\(T\)`.

- **True** forecast error as the test data is not used in computing `\(\hat{Y}_{T+h|T}\)`.

- Unlike, residuals, forecast errors on the test set involve multi-step forecasts.

- Use forecast error measures to evaluate the models.

&lt;!--Since, true forecast error, no hat involved.--&gt;
